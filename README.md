The main game works, that can be tested out by running the file "galvenais.py" I made multiple attempts at trying to get the server to run together with the clients and in the end server2 seemed to be able to run together with client2_1 and client2_2 under specific conditions(Running the whole programm in the debugger and making sure manually that the server and the clients managed to communicate with ech other correctly). I am sorry that i failed to do this on time.

I will make this work over the summer, hope that at least this project can become into something interesting in the future

install all the packages mentioned in the requirments.txt file before running.
