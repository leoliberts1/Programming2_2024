Ability to play against other people

I could make it so that I give each person the current state of the game and each of them get to make a turn, they both
will be able to render the game, but the server will be actually the one that has the game state, I will send where to where
the people want to move their things.
I will lock people and say that it is not their turn whenever they try to make a move when it is not their turn, they get to
wait untill the other person has made a choice, then they get to make a move.
The client side can only visualize the game and register the fact they want to make a move that then gets sent to the server
that changes the game state, sends it to both players and then indicates whose turn it is





The posibility of making it into a website where people can play against eachother
Find someone else that has made it and try to adjust it to this
